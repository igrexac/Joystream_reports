# YPP Report 005 (19.11.23 - 26.11.23)

This page shows a cross-section of Youtube channel connections to Gleev in the period from November 13, 2023 to November 19, 2023. 

I deliberately took **8 days** to get a larger sample. Because at the time of publication of the report, almost half of the week is missing. I took another day, but still part of the data (2.5 days are not included in any report). One obvious solution is to shift the area under consideration to fully verified days.
